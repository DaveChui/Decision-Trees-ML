1. Defining the Question
a.) Specifying the Question
Nairobi Hospital conducted a clinical camp to test for hypothyroidism. The data collected focused on Thyroid patients. Use the healthcare datasets provided to accomplish the following:

Build a model that determines whether or not the patient's symptoms indicate that the patient has hypothyroid.

b.) Determining the metric for success
While solving the specified problem, we should be able to create a model(s) which will be able to inform us of the hypothyroidism status of a specific patient which should have a realtively high accuracy considering that it involves peoples' livelihoods.

c.) Understanding the context
Using the medical field dataset provided, we're supposed to predict with the highest accuracy level whether a person has hypothyroidism or not which will be a matter of high imprortance. This is a Hypothyroidism's deficiency of thyroid hormones which can disrupt things like heart rate, body temperature and all aspects of metabolism. Major symptoms include fatigue, cold sensitivity, constipation, dry skin and unexplained weight gain. Treatment consists of thyroid hormone replacement.
